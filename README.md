  - DESCryptoServiceProvider

  - AesCryptoServiceProvider

  - RSACng

  - AESCng

In short :
• 1854—Playfair cipher invented by Charles Wheatstone.
• 1919—Edward Hebern invents the first rotor machine.
• 1943—The cipher-breaking machine Heath Robinson is completed at Bletchley Park.
• 1974—The Feistel network block cipher design is developed by Horst Feistel.
• 1976—`DES` is approved as a standard and, in January 1977, is published as a FIPS
standard for the US.
• 1977—The public-key cryptosystem `RSA` is invented.
• 1992—`MD5` is first published.
• 1995—`SHA-1` hash algorithm is published by the NSA.
• 1997—OpenPGP specification is released and a message encrypted with `DES` is cracked for the first time.
• 2001—`Rijndael` algorithm is selected as the U.S. Advanced Encryption Standard.
• 2004—`MD5` is shown to be vulnerable to collision attacks.
• 2013—Speck and Simon, which are a family of lightweight block ciphers, is publicly released by the NSA.
• 2014—The website TrueCrypt.org is suddenly and mysteriously taken down by its developers without explanation. Later audit by Steve Gibson found the departure of TrueCrypt to be well planned and concluded that the application is still safe to use.
• 2017—Google successfully performs a collision attack against `SHA-1`.
